# Morse code game
Android application written with Kotlin. It includes single and multiplayer games related to morse code.

### Coding Style
I've used this app to practice android development. Mostly this is focused on coroutines, view models and jetpack compose composables. By choice this application doesn't include popular libraries like 
dagger and hilt. There is still lot of cleaning and code optimization to be done

### Single player 
Blinking light mode were light blinks on the screen and you need to guess from 4 options what was the message

Sound (Not yet implemented)

### Multiplayer
Flashing light mode were one person can use phones flashlight to send morse code and other people can guess what the message was

1vs1 with bluetooth (Not yet implemented)

### Note
Check the MEMO file for the current situation and future development ideas
