    <string name="morse_letters_overview">morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text \
    characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, \
    or dits and dahs.\n\nsource: wikipedia</string>
    <string name="morse_letters_words_per_minute">Proficiency in Morse code is measured in how many words per \
    minute someone can send or receive. This seems a tricky concept given that you can send more \
    short words per minute than long ones. The work-around is to standardise on the word "PARIS" as \
    the standard word, so if Morse is being sent at 20 words per minute (or "20 wpm") then the word \
    "PARIS" (or, more precisely "PARIS " with a space on the end) could be sent 20 times in a \
    minute.\n\nSource: MorseCode.world</string>
